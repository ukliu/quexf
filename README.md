QueXF with Material Design
==========================

##What is it?
QueXF is popular, open source form verification and data entry system. http://quexf.sourceforge.net/
<br />The default user interface for this is pretty barebone.
<br />So, I've improved it's user interface and UX by applying [Google's Material Design Specifications](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) 

##Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Configure this project according to https://sandilands.info/sgordon/using-quexf-in-ubuntu-for-questionnaires
3. Use `bower install` to install frontend dependencies.
4. Admin panel has been redesigned with material design. check it at http://localhost/quexf/admin/ (replace localhost with your domain name, if any.)


I do not develope or maintain QueXF.<br />
QueXF is a project developed by Mr. Adam Zammit
